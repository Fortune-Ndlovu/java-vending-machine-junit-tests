## Introduction

The Java Vending Machine is a basic application written in Java. It provides a textual interface for users to interact with the vending machine, make selections, and receive products if they have enough balance. The application uses simple command-line input and output for user interactions.

## Usage

To use the Java Vending Machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your Java development environment (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
3. Compile the `VendingMachine.java` file.
4. Run the compiled Java program to start the vending machine.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the vending machine.
6. Enjoy your selected products!

## Features

The Java Vending Machine offers the following features:

- Inserting coins into the machine.
- Displaying available products and their prices.
- Selecting a product for purchase.
- Checking the balance after inserting coins.
- Handling insufficient funds and displaying appropriate messages.

## Setup

2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code: [Download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Testing

The Java Vending Machine project includes a set of JUnit tests to ensure the correctness of its functionality. These tests are located in the `VendingMachineTest.java` file.

To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in your Java development environment (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
2. Navigate to the `VendingMachineTest.java` file.
3. Right-click on the file and select "Run Test" to execute all test cases.
4. The test results will be displayed in the test runner.
